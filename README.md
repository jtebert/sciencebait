If you're interested in how the headlines are generated, the relevant code is in [clickbaitgen.py](https://github.com/jtebert/sciencebait/blob/master/baitgen/clickbaitgen.py) and [pick_word.py](https://github.com/jtebert/sciencebait/blob/master/baitgen/pick_word.py), and you can edit the words used by changing the text files in the [source_words](https://github.com/jtebert/sciencebait/tree/master/baitgen/source_words) directory.
